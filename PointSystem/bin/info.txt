Hey, to get started you have to go to the following page:

pointsystemo.herokuapp.com

(or scan/press the QR-code bellow)

Here, will you find a text box. To connect to the right
computer you have to write in the same code as you can find
on you computer. Before you press "Go Online", you can 
choose this code by writing it in to the text field under 
"Code", on your computer. The code have to be 4-10 
symbols long. If you choose to not make any code, one will 
be generated for you. 
After you have written the right code in to the text box on
the web page, you will get to a  editable page, witch is 
synchronized with you computer, as long as the "Go Online" 
button is activated.
As long as "Go Online" is activated you are not able to 
change the points from the computer. However you can 
change the names and it is possible to turn it of and 
then on again, but it is not synchronized in this period.
